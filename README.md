> Read the Structure section — We use both Rust and Python and they go in different places

## Setup
Create a virtual envirement
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Source the virtual envirement
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install maturin
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
Build the Rust code
```
maturin build --release
```

Install the module (Note: the version will change so check the exact filename in `target/wheels/`)
```
pip install target/wheels/lstore-0.1.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl --force-reinstall
```

Run the database benchmark
```
python3 __main__.py
```

You should see this for milestone 1.

#### lstore
The lstore (`./lstore`) directory is where the Python code goes. This is what gets called by the tests in `__main__.py`. The lstore directory can be referred to as a Python module.

#### src
The src (`./src`) directory is where the Rust code goes. This gets called by the code in the lstore module.

`system.rs` - all the functions and structs related to getting information from the system machine
`database.rs` - the database struct and the related functions

## Testing

### Rust testing

```
cargo test
```

Here is what the correct output should look like. You should see multiple tests passing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6aee0b5-571f-4450-9381-296efc5e2f73)

#### Unit Tests

Rust unit tests are located in each Rust file and can be found in `./src`

#### Integration Tests

The integration tests are located at `./tests` and are also run with `cargo test`

### Python testing
```
pytest
```

Python tests are located in a separate directory called `tests` located in `./python`

## Rust Docs

Rust has a way of making docs from the source code. Run `cargo doc` and view the produced HTML page in your browser. Adding comments to yor code starting with `///` will be put into these docs.

## Speed Analysis

### Using flamegraph to benchmark

You may need to install flamegraph with `cargo install flamegraph`

```sh
cargo flamegraph --test update_tests
```

```sh
# Open the svg (It's nice to view in a browser)
firefox flamegraph.svg
```

Preview:

### Running cargo benchmarks

This will take a long time but you can run benchmarks separately.

```sh
cargo bench
```

You can use `cargo bench` to see if your changes significantly affect performance.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/367e1f7a-dd85-46ed-998a-939f95a1b561)

Often small changes can happen randomly. Like this has no change in the code.
Try to run the bench as the only thing running on the system.

### Using maturin in release mode

Data for both graphs can be found [here](./python/benchmarks/speedtests.py)

### Running with debug or info logging

To use the logger, import the debug, error, or info macro from the log crate.
Then you can add the macros to code like `debug!("Start database!");`.
When you go to run the code, you can set the env var `RUST_LOG=debug`.
Docs: https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/.

### We tried Pypy

We started to try using Pypy which is a runtime for Python that is supposedly faster. Because of [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), we actually can't get all that much performance out of it. We also found that the newest version of Pypy cannot use the newest version of Pyo3, so future work is needed to get them to run together.

Future questions:
- [ ] How much time does the Python part take up?
- [x] How do we measure the improvement from Python to Pypy
- [x] How do we downgrade Pypy to work with Py03

We opted to go for C Python because it's much faster in this use case. We show the results of some tests [here](./python/py-opt/cpython-vs-pypy.md).

### Profiling Python

We use `py-spy` to profile Python and we got expected results. It shows that the main use of Python is just the update function when testM2.py is run.

Here is how we ran it:

```
py-spy record -o profile.svg -- python3 testM2.py
```

[profile](./profile.svg)

### Moving everything possible to Rust

We used to make a ReturnRecord object for every single row! We also would turn the result of rquery into a list, wrap each in ReturnRecord and then make that back into a new list. ReturnRecord would also do list truncation each time it was initialized (for each row). We moved all of this logic into Rust can simply return what the Rust function returns. This change improved the performance by over 30%. The speed of testM2.py went from 1.30 seconds to 0.92 seconds. These results we consistent across 3 different runs each done in an interwoven fashion (with change, then without change, then with change again, etc.) for a total of 6 runs. The change can be seen in [PR#162](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/ecs-165a-database/pull/162).

```diff
-   class ReturnRecord:
-       def __init__(self, columns: List[int]):
-           self.columns = columns[4:]
-
-       def __str__(self):
-           return f"Record({self.columns})"

-   return [
-       ReturnRecord(
-           list(
-               self.rquery.select_version(
-                   search_key,
-                   search_key_index,
-                   projected_columns_index,
-                   relative_version,
-               )
-           )
-       )
-   ]
+   return self.rquery.select_version(
+       search_key,
+       search_key_index,
+       projected_columns_index,
+       relative_version,
+   )
```

This includes `insert` and `update`.

### Using FxHashMap instead of default HashMap

The Rust defualt HashMap is a great general purpose HashMap implementation and is very fast but FxHashMap is a decent bit faster.
After changing the page directory to use FxHashMap in [PR#186](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/ecs-165a-database/pull/186), the speed of many reads and writes improved by over 28% and the overall speed of all the benchmarks improved by by over 26%.

```rs
use crate::container::{ReservedColumns, NUM_RESERVED_COLUMNS};
use crate::index::RIndexHandle;
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use rustc_hash::FxHashMap;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, RwLock};

type RedoxQLHasher<K, V> = FxHashMap<K, V>;

#[derive(Default, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PageDirectoryMetadata {
    pub directory: HashMap<i64, RecordMetadata>,
    pub directory: RedoxQLHasher<i64, RecordMetadata>,
}

#[derive(Default, Clone)]
pub struct PageDirectory {
    pub directory: HashMap<i64, Record>,
    pub directory: RedoxQLHasher<i64, Record>,
}
// -- snip --
```
