> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read the Structure section â€” We use both Rust and Python and they go in different places

## Setup
Create a virtual envirement
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Source the virtual envirement
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install maturin
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
Build the Rust code
```
maturin build --release
```

Install the module (Note: the version will change so check the exact filename in `target/wheels/`)
```
pip install target/wheels/lstore-0.1.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl --force-reinstall
```

Run the database benchmark
```
python3 __main__.py
```

You should see this for milestone 1.

#### lstore
The lstore (`./lstore`) directory is where the Python code goes. This is what gets called by the tests in `__main__.py`. The lstore directory can be referred to as a Python module.

#### src
The src (`./src`) directory is where the Rust code goes. This gets called by the code in the lstore module.

`system.rs` - all the functions and structs related to getting information from the system machine
`database.rs` - the database struct and the related functions

## Testing

#### Rust testing
```
cargo test
```

Here is what the correct output should look like. You should see multiple tests passing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6aee0b5-571f-4450-9381-296efc5e2f73)

Rust tests are located in each Rust file and can be found in `./src`

#### Python testing
```
pytest
```

Python tests are located in a seperate directory called `tests` located in `./python`

## Rust Docs

Rust has a way of making docs from the source code. Run `cargo doc` and view the produced HTML page in your browser. Adding comments to yor code starting with `///` will be put into these docs.
