## Structure

#### lstore
The lstore (`./lstore`) directory is where the Python code goes. This is what gets called by the tests in `__main__.py`. The lstore directory can be referred to as a Python module.

#### src
The src (`./src`) directory is where the Rust code goes. This gets called by the code in the lstore module.
