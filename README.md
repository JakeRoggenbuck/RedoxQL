> Read the Structure section â€” We use both Rust and Python and they go in different places

## Setup
Create a virtual envirement
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Install maturin
```
pip install maturin
```

## Running
Build the Rust code
```
maturin build
```

Install the module (Note: the version will change so check the exact filename in `target/wheels/`)
```
pip install target/wheels/lstore-0.1.0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_34_x86_64.whl
```

#### lstore
The lstore (`./lstore`) directory is where the Python code goes. This is what gets called by the tests in `__main__.py`. The lstore directory can be referred to as a Python module.

#### src
The src (`./src`) directory is where the Rust code goes. This gets called by the code in the lstore module.
